After doing a lot of research, I think that I've found a few master reference guides to shore up my programming weaknesses, one for Data Science, one for Computer Science, and the other for general employ-ability (I'm not certain that's a real word):

[Open Source Society - Computer Science](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science)

[Reddit - Data Science Learning Path](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6qjhic/what_do_you_think_of_the_learning_path_i_built/)

[P1XT Guides](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides)

I've also considered using the FreeCodeCamp Beta to shore up my Web Dev Skills, but it seems like some components still need some work before being useful for learning - especially the chapters on utilizing test frameworks (Chai/Mocha)

For the time being, I think I'll work on the CS50x course and the first few courses recommended by Open Source Society -> After that, maybe I'll take the CS109 Course that is suggested for Data Science.

Any recommendations on Math Courses would be much appreciated -> I'll be using Khan Academy's Linear Algebra course first, then we'll see what seems most appealing after that!

Cool stuff - looks like there's a Data Science Humble Book Bundle that's up right now! I really like this thing -> I think that there are a few books that I definitely want to dig into, here's some impressions on the books that I've stolen from Reddit:

1. ***Think Stats*** - Looks like this is probably a good starter book, alongside the Head First and "Doing Data Science" books, we'll see how they complement each other.
1. ***Head First Data Analysis*** - I think I'll be reading this before "Doing Data Science" -> I'm a little concerned that it could be my first time using R, but that can be supplemented.
1. ***Doing Data Science*** - This is a little rough, since the source code is not readily available, so this might be a pain to go through. Also, it seems to be more about breadth rather than depth, so that's to be taken into consideration as well
1. ***Data Science at the Command Line*** I'll probably use after reading the Linux Command Line book, looks like it covers more shell commands which I desperately need practice with.
- ***R in a Nutshell*** -> This looks like a master reference guide for R, I won't be using this for *learning* R, but it'll probably be my go-to for referencing R Functions after getting the basics down elsewhere.
1. ***Think Bayes*** - According to Reddit, this is something I could hold off on until I get to Machine Learning stuff, so maybe I'll do that
- ***Practical Machine Learning with H20*** has great reviews, maybe I'll cover this once I'm comfortable enought with either R or Python (The book has code examples for each language)
- ***Hadoop: The Definitive Guide***, ***Cassandra: The Definitive Guide***, and the Spark Books will stay on my backlog - I just can't predict which I'll end up wanting/needing to use in the future.

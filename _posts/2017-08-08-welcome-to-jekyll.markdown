It's been a long time coming - I finally spent a few minutes and built a quick site with Jekyll & GitHub pages for a domain I bought *months* ago!
I'm looking forward to using this as my new note-taking repository, and to share some projects that are beginning to formulate in my mind.
I'll be leaving the below guide as a self-reference, in the future I'll definitely be using it for generating my notes.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
